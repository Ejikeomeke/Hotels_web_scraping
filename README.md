# Hotels Webscraping Project
This is a practical webscrapping project we executed during my bootcamp in 10alytics.

## Business Problem
BizInfo is a burgeoning business directory startup dedicated to providing comprehensive and accurate information about businesses across various sectors.
Their platform serves as a valuable resource for individuals and other businesses seeking to connect and engage within the Nigerian market.


BizInfo has identified a significant challenge: the hotel listings within their Nigerian directory are plagued by inconsistencies and inaccuracies. This includes:
● Outdated Information
● Missing Data
● Data Discrepancies
● Incomplete Listings

## Rationale for the Project

Hotels.ng is a leading online hotel booking platform in Nigeria, renowned for its extensive and up-to-date database of hotels. By scraping data from Hotels.ng, BizInfo can:
● Improve Data Accuracy: Leverage Hotels.ng's regularly updated information to rectify inconsistencies and ensure data accuracy within
its own directory.
● Enhance Data Completeness: Fill in missing data points and enrich hotel listings with detailed information sourced from Hotels.ng.
● Gain a Competitive Edge: Offer a more reliable and comprehensive hotel directory compared to competitors.

## Aim of the Project
1. Create a Python-based web scraping system to efficiently extract hotel data from Hotels.ng.
2. Improve the accuracy and completeness of BizInfo's hotel listings by integrating
scraped data.
3. Implement a system for regularly updating BizInfo's hotel data to maintain accuracy over time.
4. Increase the reliability and value of BizInfo's hotel directory, leading to improved
user satisfaction.

## Tech Stack
1. Python
2. Selenium
3. Beautifulsoup

5. Pandas

## Project Workflow
Here is an overview of the flow of task for this
project:
